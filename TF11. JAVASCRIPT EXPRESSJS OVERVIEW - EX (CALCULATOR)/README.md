# :triangular_ruler: Exercise: Calculator using Javascript and ExpressJS

Problem for exercises and homework from the [Software Technologies](https://github.com/OgnyanDD/Software-Technologies) course @ [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/).<br/>
Creating a **Calculator** application with the **Express.js Framework**, from setting up the framework, to implementing the models, views and controllers necessary for function of application.<br/>
*To start the app, see *"package.json"* to install all necessary packages.*
<br/>
**I have implemented changes to the functionality of the calculator and its design, which differ from its default idea in the task!**<br/>
