# :triangular_ruler: Exercise: Calculator using Java and Spring

Problem for exercises and homework from the [Software Technologies](https://github.com/OgnyanDD/Software-Technologies) course @ [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/).<br/>
Creating a **Calculator** application with the **Spring Framework**.<br/>
**I have implemented changes to the functionality of the calculator and its design, which differ from its default idea in the task!**<br/>

**Sumary of my project:**
* Created new view with new design;
* Created calculator model;
* Implement the controller action;
* Added eight new mathematical functions to calculator;
* A new button has been created to reset all fields in calculator;
* etc.<br/>

**Follow these steps to run the application:**
- Install JDK (if you not have it);
- Import project to take the Maven dependencies;
- Write *"http://localhost:8000/"* in your browser;<br/>
