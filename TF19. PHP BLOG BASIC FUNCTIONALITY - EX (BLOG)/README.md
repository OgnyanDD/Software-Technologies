# :triangular_ruler: Exercise: PHP BLOG basic functionality

Problem for exercises and homework from the [Software Technologies](https://github.com/OgnyanDD/Software-Technologies) course @ [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/).<br/>
Creating a **Blog** application with the **Symfony Framework**, from setting up the framework through the authentication module, to creating a **CRUD** around Doctrine entities.<br/>
**I have implemented changes to the functionality of the BLOG and its design, which differ from its default idea in the task!**<br/>

**Sumary of my project:**

  
**Follow these steps to run the application:**

- Install composer (if you not have it);
- Start MySQL server to listen;
- Create data base with name "blog";
- Open CMD terminal in project folder;
- Write "composer install" to take the dependeces;
- Write "php doctrine:schema:update --force" to update the database;<br/>
