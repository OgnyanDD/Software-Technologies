# :triangular_ruler: Exercise: Calculator using PHP and Symfony

Problem for exercises and homework from the [Software Technologies](https://github.com/OgnyanDD/Software-Technologies) course @ [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/).<br/>
Creating a **Calculator** application with the **Symfony Framework**.<br/>
**I have implemented changes to the functionality of the calculator and its design, which differ from its default idea in the task!**<br/>

**Sumary of my project:**
* Created new view with new design;
* Created calculator class file;
* Created calculator fields;
* Created accessors and mutators (getters and setters);
* Created a form in-app;
* Implement calculator logic;
* Added eight new mathematical functions to calculator;
* A new button has been created to reset all fields in calculator;
* etc.<br/>

**Follow these steps to run the application:**
- Install composer (if you not have it);
- Open CMD terminal in project folder;
- Write *"composer install"* to take the dependecies;
- Write *"php bin/console server:run"* to start the application;<br/>
