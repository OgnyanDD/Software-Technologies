# T6. Exercise: HTML5 and CSS - BLOG DESIGN

Problem for exercises and homework from the [Software Technologies](https://github.com/OgnyanDD/Software-Technologies) course @ [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/).
This exercise use bootstrap extensively, so every HTML code will be instantly stylized and will look good off the shelf. This is not the case when manualy write plain HTML without ready styles.
<br/>
**I have implemented changes to the functionality of the blog and its design, which differ from its default idea in the task!**
